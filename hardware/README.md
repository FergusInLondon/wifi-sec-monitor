# WiFi Security Monitor: Hardware

All datasheets and schematics are contained in this directory.

This is my first hardware project - other than a few simple Arduino based projects - so it's likely a little rough around the edges!

## Hardware Design

1. Detection of the presence of a functional load (or blown fuse) via the ASC712 current sensor;
2. status LEDs for WiFi, relay output, and overall health;
3. both hardware based (i.e pushbutton) and software triggered reset of microcontroller, wifi, and output buffer (shift register);
4. programmatic control of the ESP01 mode - allowing programming without any manual intervention;
5. a simple HTTP based API for controlling power output and viewing the status of all peripherals;


#### Hardware Considerations

This could be simplified quite a bit via the use of an ADC (for current sensors as well ), a WiFi enabled controller like the NodeMCU (reducing the use of an ESP8266/ESP-01 in addition to the Uno),and perhaps a transistor array for the control of ESP01 mode and reset functionalities. 

This is very rough, and likely going to be subject to a lot of experimentation and refactoring.

## Schematics


### Main Control Board

**Schematic:** Main Control Board.sch

The Main Control Board contains the circuitry needed to drive the relay board, provides some basic status LEDs, and opens a WiFi interface via the ESP01.

The Arduino Uno interfaces with a 74HC595 Shift Register, providing 8 output channels, which in turn drives a MIC2981 Current Source Driver Array (i.e Darlington Transistor Array) - powering a status LED and the appropriate Relay found on the Relay Driver Board. 

Interfaces with: Thermistors (via I2C comms w/ ADC), Relay Load Current Sensors (via I2C comms w/ ADC), and Output Board.

### Relay Control Module

[**Directory:**](schematics/Relay%20Control%20Module)

The Relay Control Board drives 12VDC to 4 DC Barrel Jack connections, complete with current monitoring and over-current protection.

The board consists of four Sanyou SRD relays, powering a DC Barrel Jack with an inline fuse. Current is monitored via an ACS712 IC.
