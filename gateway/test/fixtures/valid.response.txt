t=0 t1=43 t2=39 t3=53 t4=32 u=1606379675

# relay 1 (o=1) switched on (s=0), active current is 321mAh (c=321), and functioning correctly without errors (e=0)
t=1 o=1 s=1 c=321 e=0
# relay 2 (o=2) switched on (s=1), but no current (c=0), which means ErrorFaultyLoadNoCurrent (e=1)
t=1 o=2 s=1 c=0 e=1
# relay 3 (o=3) switched off, no current, and no error
t=1 o=3 s=0 c=0 e=0
# relay 4 (o=4) switched off, BUT with 542mAh of current (c=542), which means ErrorFaultyLoadCurrentPresent (e=2)
t=1 o=4 s=0 c=542 e=2

# Error Counts (since turn-on):
# t  = TYPE          [int, payload type, value = 2]
# ot = OVERTEMP      [int, count of 'overtemp' conditions - count since last power on]
# lf = LOAD_FAILURES [int, count of 'load' failures - i.e. where an output current has been 0 for a sensor that's on]
